## Sodoku Solver Ver_1

## Description
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle in which the player is introduced by a 9 x 9 grid. 
The goal of the puzzle is so that each column, row, and 3 x 3 grid is composed of values
from 1 to 9 without having duplicate values in the same section. 

In this version of the sodoku solver, the grid will be premade with values already chosen in 
certain positions. The computer will solve the puzzle with its own algorithm. The program 
will be using Tkinter which will provide the animation of how the computer will solve the mystery.
